# Auto Hotspot

Small demo project to get familiar with the
[Nearby API](https://developers.google.com/nearby/connections/overview) for
[Robot Scouter](https://github.com/SUPERCILEX/Robot-Scouter)'s
[Auto Scout feature](https://github.com/SUPERCILEX/Robot-Scouter/issues/55).

I have a spare Android M phone which I use as a hotspot occasionally. This app acts as a remote control to
enable/disable the hotspot on the other device. The "server" is the hotspot device and the "client"
is the device who can enable/disable the hotspot.

PS: apologies for such ugly UI and code. ðŸ˜Š
